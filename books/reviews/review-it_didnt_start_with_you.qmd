**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Book that talks about trauma that can be passed done to later generations. Talks
about how to resolve that trauma by going back up the generations for the source.
Frankly I didn't like it

***Too many red flags early on where I knew I wasn't going to like this***

Regardless of the actual material and stance (which I find suspicious on its own),
this book does not give me confidence of its efficacy.

There are *only* stories that have happy resolutions stemming from the idea of
'inherited trauma'. And there does not seem any reference to evidence this is
true and actually helps outside these stories. There are citations but looking
carefully, they are quite a few pre-1960 references and usually are only citing
the adjacent science versus anything directly related to this 'inherited trauma'.

I think this was a book I just grabbed from the library over a recommendation.
Which seems likely because I don't think anyone in my circles would have ever 
even mentioned this book if they read it.


**I'm suspicious of books like this where I'm used to more 'science-based' books**
