**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
The team gets sent back in time (again) but this time in the age of the
dinosaurs. Technically a book that doesn't really progress the series.

***Dinosaurs!***

I remember this one a lotâ€“ I had the physical book from when I was young! It
really just goes right into the story with not nearly as much fluff at the
beginning as you usually get from these books.

I really felt for Cassie's empathy for all living creatures. I feel this has
become a more typical feeling compared to ~25 years ago when this was written.
But it was still very much written as 'yes we humans are animals, but we have 
the capacity to recognize living things can hurt'.


**Tobias loving dinosaurs is too perfect**
