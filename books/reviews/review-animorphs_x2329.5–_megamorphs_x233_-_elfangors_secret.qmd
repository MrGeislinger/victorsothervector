***This goes really hard on the brutality of war***

I feel you really see how bad war and fighting can be. We literally see a couple
characters deaths but also the characters having to be surrounded by the death
and aftermath of killing. Marco describes screaming without any classic dialogue.
Ax has two people literally fall over dead on top of him.

Even Rachel who 'wants' to fight has a hard time processing the damage she causes.

In the end, the final solution is basically to make a real human (Visser Four's host)
to never exist. This is probably the most brutal thing I've seen in Animorphs
where they (Cassie) literally explains to a human how he will no longer exist.
And he accepts it.


**I do like they ponder for a second at how even the stuff they do now might have unintended & unpredictable outcomes**
