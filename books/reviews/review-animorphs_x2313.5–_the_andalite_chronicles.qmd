**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
The 8th book in the Animorphs series narrated by Ax (the only Andalite of the
Animorphs)
<br/>
<br/>


::: 

***First Prequel for the Animorphs Series***

You get to learn about Elfganor, the Andalite alien who gave the Animorphs their
morphing power.

You learn their story is a little more determined and special than you first
realized.


**Lot's of nostalgia for me.**
