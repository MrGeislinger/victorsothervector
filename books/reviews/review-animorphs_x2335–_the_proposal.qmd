girlfriend.

***A reminder that they're also kids even if they have to be in war***

The ending really made me laugh thinking that the Animorphs basically annoyed
the Yeerk to the point of breaking on camera. It just all seems very silly for
something that was such high stakes.

Also, I thought it was interesting to see the book lead into the next one 
([Visser](https://www.victorsothervector.com/books/book-animorphs_x2335.5%E2%80%93_visser.html)).
Almost all the books end as a standalone so it was interesting to see how this
directly tied into the next book.


**Ending with a 'to be continued' is cute**
