**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Narrated by Visser One (Marco's Yeerk-controlled mom) at the 'present time'.
They're on trial so you learn of their life and see how the Yeerks take on human emotion.
<br/>
<br/>


:::


***More evidence that Yeerks can have emotions, at least brought out by humans***



**Interesting to see how this directly ties to the current story line from the Animorphs**
