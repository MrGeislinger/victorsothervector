**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
This was one of the two books I heard mentioned from a child psychologist being that one was 'good' and the other was less helpful. I don't think this is the 'good' book. It was fine but kept feeling this was more about shocking stories. I didn't get as much out of it as maybe someone who hasn't really considered how addictions & neurotransmitters affect the brain.
