**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
This was one of the two books I heard mentioned from a child psychologist being that one was 'good' and the other was less helpful. I think this was the 'good' book. It did have me reframe my thinking about what dopamine really is. I liked it but I was skeptical of some implications made by the authors.
