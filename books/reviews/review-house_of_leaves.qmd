**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
This book really shines in how its physically structured with the story told in
the footnotes of footnotes and appendices. It's meant to emulate a non-fiction
book while also telling (at least) two different stories that have different
parallels to one another. If this book could be summarized, **its vibe is
*layers***.
