**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
The Animorphs have to make the most important decision they've ever faced: Do they continue to fight the Yeerks in secret, or is it time to let everyone know there's a resistance?

But he's getting tired of the pressure. Even though he realizes his friends need him to be strong, he doesn't feel that way. In fact, he feels just the opposite. And Jake knows if he starts to lose it, the Animorphs are done...
