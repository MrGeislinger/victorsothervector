***Damn***

This book narrated by Rachel feels like to me a turning point in the series.

The plots have teetered right at the edge of going full into how dark this all
is. It's always been young teenagers (middle school?) having to do impossible
things and impossible decisions.

But over the past couple books, especially this one I think really drives that
they're not 'kids' any more and are never going back to a 'normal' life.

Rachel clearly sees that she has a ferocity that works well for 'war' but is
definitely bothered by it. We see that Jake knows that he has to use his
friends/team strategically. Even gentle Cassie is the one who designs the plot
to trick the traitor in being forever a rodent.

The end shows it's not a 'victory' but something that was necessary and never
want to think about. But even at the end, it's chilling to see they're reminded
it's just not done and their traitor David will still be forever alone as a rat
on a small island.


**I wonder if this is a point where the series shifts**
