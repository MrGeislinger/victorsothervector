**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Animorphs find them selves in the Arctic and basically are there for the plot
so they can get new morphs.

***Marco is being really 'Marco''***

This one book seemed just a bit 'different'â€“ I immediately noticed that Marco
felt just a little extra. But looking up this book, you can see that this was
from a ghost writer (Jeffrey Zeuhlke) so wondering if that's what I was feeling.

Back to the story, I love that the one human they met is casual about the known
alien/Yerk base and seeing the Animorphs morphing. Also hilarious that the team
basically just shrugs that it probably won't matter since this guy is out on
his own and no one believe him. Very different from every other time they
worried about someone discovering their secret.


**This is the first ghostwriter book; we'll see how the rest go**
