**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
The 8th book in the Animorphs series narrated by Ax (the only Andalite of the
Animorphs)
<br/>
<br/>


:::


***Surprise, alien doesn't understand humans.***

Ax tells their story

We learn that the Yerks exist because of Andalites being kind & giving them
technology

**Really enjoyed it.**
