**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
The Chee androids malfunction and apparently it's in part from Crayak trying to
cause issues. So the team has to dive dee (as giant squids) into the ocean to
get to the Permalite (Chee creators) ship.

***Rachel continues to be Rachel but touches more about relationship with Tobias***

This personally felt less interesting since I think there wasn't as much
character development from beginning to end. Rachel is clearly addicted to the
'fight' and has feelings for Tobias even if he's 'stuck' as a hawk.

But not a bad story. Gave a little more world-building especially hearing how
the Permalite's ship and design is really super trusting. (They are essentially
dogs after all so it fits.)


**These ghost writers might end up focusing more on world development over character development**
