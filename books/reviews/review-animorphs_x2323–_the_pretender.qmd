**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Tobias learns that his father is Elfganor and correctly
reasons that it was some Ellimist wackiness.

***Tobias never gets the home he really needs***

I love that Tobias has this internal struggle of being a human and a hawk.
But I also love that at the end of the book, he leans into both.
Especially with him taking care of the small bunniesâ€“ his makeshift family since he doesn't have one.


**Him turning into a human to cry breaks my heart**
