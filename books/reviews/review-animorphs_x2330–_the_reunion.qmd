**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Marco discovers his Mom controlled by Visser One is still alive but lying low.
The team comes up with a plan to pit Visser One & Visser Three against each other
while Marco struggles wit separating the emotional attachment with his once
thought dead mother and having to fight a war that will kill her.
<br/>
<br/>


:::


***Definitely convoluted plan that probably would never work***

Marco goes back and forth about what to feel about his Yerk-controlled mom.

Also, clearly Visser One is much smarter than Visser Three & other Yerks since
they quickly put two and two together to figure that the Animorphs are at least
in part humans. Also recognizes Marco just via 'though-speech'.

So this will probably coming up again next time Visser One appears.

**Marco's mom will be back another day**
