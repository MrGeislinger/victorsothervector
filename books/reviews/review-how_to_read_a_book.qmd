**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
This was an interesting book to read in a few ways. First was that the 'revised 
& updated' edition was updated in the 1970s from the 1940s book, so it had me
wondering how much advice the book gives is now 'common knowledge'. The other
interesting aspect for me (which might be related to my earlier point) is how
much of the techniques and strategies described are things I already do! 
But overall, I think this book was worth reading in that it at least had me
thinknig more about how I read & what I want to read.

***I couldn't help but think about this book in how it fits in with a world 50 years after it was 'revised'.***

It was funny to read in the introduction from the 1970s on how TV & radio are
becoming more prevalent and reflecting how much more there is in the modern
world.

As I read, I could see snippets of what seems to be presented as a 'new' way
approach to reading (beyond what is taught in school & university) that have
been incorporated in my learning from the (relative) modern age. One big aspect
was what I was told as 'talking to the text' which was repeated over and over
again when going through grade school. But there was other advice that I know
has been said to me in the past but I can almost guarantee is rarely followed,
such as 'skimming' or 'pre-reading'.

There were some frankly laughable parts that I either felt was obvious or even
outdated such as the section on 'How to Use a Dictionary'. There were also parts
that I felt less inclined to follow for myself such as being dilligent in taking
notes on a sections to reference later.

***A lot of the techniques described really fits well with trying to use books as research towards an overarching goal.***

The steps detailed basically can be summarized to be:

1. **Elementary Reading**: Basically reading for understanding
2. **Inspectional Reading**: Skimming & pre-reading to determine what the book is about (and if it's worth reading for your 'goal')
3. **Analytical Reading**: Understanding the book as a whole and the arguments it presents and how convinced you are of them
4. **Syntopical Reading:** Taking in multiple references to broaden & deepen knowledge in the area

There was a lot that I discovered I already do such as varying my speed while
reading a book to focus on the 'important'/'relevant' parts. I actually think
some of the techniques could be revised to something like 
_'How to Watch a Video'_.

I don't feel like this was a 'mind-blowing' read, but at least for me it has me
reflecting on how I want to approach future reading. In the past, I've grouped
books to read together based on subject and even read some simulataneously. This
_'How to Read a Book'_ has me thinking about maybe trying out doing almost a 
'research' read. One thing that comes to mind is maybe trying to read philosophy
as if it was part of a class. (I always wanted to do more humanities like that
while at university but never found the time.)


***'How to Read a Book' can be refreshing in just having you reflect what you want to get out of your reading.***
