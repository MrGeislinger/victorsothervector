**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Tobias is purposefully captured by the Yerks to trick them into thinking their
anti-morphing ray doesn't work.
We see Tobias hide behind his hawk-self to get through being tortured by a human
controller who blurs the line of identity between Yerk and human.
<br/>
<br/>


:::


***Probably the most the reader experiences so far of torture***

You see glimpses of Tobias' life emphasizing where he fits in between human,
hawk, and an Andalite father. It's getting harder to explain this book to those
not familiar with it.

**Seeing the blurred lines of Yerk & human controller feels like it's setting it up to be more key point**
