**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
The Animorphs look into the Yerks taking over some animal testing lab and a
meat packing site. Turns out the Yerks have been trying to remove 'free will'
from humans by first testing on animals.

***Basic exploring about treatment of non-human animals that a young teen might be able to recognize***

Definitely very blunt about real-life treatment of non-human animals. Especially
since it's narrated by the only alien in the group who can technically be
impartial to common practices done on Earth.

As you might expect, Cassie and Marco are on the opposite ends of the spectrum.
The book clearly leans towards Cassie's view that animals deserve our respect
even if they aren't fully sentient, but especially so. Marco has a much more
direct "but they're animals" attitude and is more than willing to accept animal
harm if it's especially inconvenient to their goals to prevent it. Ax, the
narrator, represent the neutral voice and debate that we as human society has
on where we draw lines.

Interesting to see the book go from debating about whether they should save
the chimpanzees in the lab to where the team is in a situation of deciding to
free some humans in cages. Definitely tries to draw parallels in a relatively
straight-forward fashion that a young teen might connect the dots.

This book overall doesn't really progress the story (or at least I don't see how
it will). This being another ghost writer story, I'm seeing that these tend to
be relatively self-contained. And I don't know if it's because we're about 30
books into the series or because this was a ghost writer, but the beginning
feels particularly rushed in explaining the Animorphs (as they do every book).


**I'll probably not try and look at which are by ghost writters since I catch myself thinking about that more**
