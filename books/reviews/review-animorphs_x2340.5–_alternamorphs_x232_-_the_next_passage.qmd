**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Choose your own adventure where you replace the story line of David from
*[Animorphs #20: The Discovery](https://www.victorsothervector.com/books/book-animorphs_x2320%E2%80%93_the_discovery.html)*

***More complex decisions***

Uses stories from:
- *[Animorphs #26: The Attack](https://www.victorsothervector.com/books/book-animorphs_x2326%E2%80%93_the_attack.html)*
- *[Megamorphs #2 â€“ In the Time of the Dinosaurs](https://www.victorsothervector.com/books/book-animorphs_x2318.5%E2%80%93_megamorphs_x232_-_in_the_time_of_dinosaurs.html)*

**I like that you end up at the beginning even if you 'win'**
