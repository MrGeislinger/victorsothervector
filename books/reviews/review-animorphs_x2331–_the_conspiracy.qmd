**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Another family is infested with Yerks book where a family funeral means a long
trip where Tom (controlled by a Yerk) won't survive since they need to feed on
alien lights every three days. So the plot turns from turning Jake's dad into a
controller to killing him.
<br/>
Jake struggles with the personal matter.

***The family funeral is of Jake's Great-Grandpa who fought in WWII mirroring Jake being in a secret war***

The plot isn't super important since as expected, nothing really changes from the
beginning to the end.

But this at least has Jake have to face being a person & kid with personal ties
and emotions that go up against the needs in fighting this war. Of course, this
personal situation doesn't really match much of war. Except maybe it does with
how you have a duty as a soldier for the cause while also trying to stay alive
for you and your family at home.

Don't know how intention the end is, but Jake ponders having trinkets & medals
from this Yerk war in the future like his great-grandfather. This to me reads
that he's completely in the mindset that he is a soldier first and his main
identity now. This feels particularly sad to me since he's really still just a
kid.

**Jake & the Animorphs have to be a soldier all the time with no real break**
