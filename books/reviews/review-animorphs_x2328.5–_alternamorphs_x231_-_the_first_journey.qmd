***Kind of feels like another exploration of the failed Animorph David***

Even if you go through all the options, this is till a good 10%+ shorter than
the rest of the books. You can feel it go by real quick and honestly the first
book that I felt was really not worth reading.

But I absolutely remember reading this as a kid! Definitely having to choose
which animal has made a lasting memory for me. ♥️

**Man choosing at random means you're likely going to die as an Animorph**
