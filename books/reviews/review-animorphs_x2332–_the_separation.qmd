**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Uh, so Rachel gets cut in half during a starfish morph and is now two identical
Rachels with two personalities. How the hell does morphing even work??

***Classic 90s***

As you might expect, the two Rachels really complement each other in order to
be anything useful. Teamwork makes the dream work ♥️♥️

**Totally an episode of ['Rick and Morty'](https://youtu.be/OVt-nq6YyRM)**
