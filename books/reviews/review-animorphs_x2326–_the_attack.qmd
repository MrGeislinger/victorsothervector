**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
The team learns more about the Ellimist and their enemy Crayak while being
whisked away to an alien world of diverged species of Yerk that they're trying
to save from extinction by Crayak.

(Yeah, like for real.)

***The Ellimist strikes again***

The enemy Howler that has been designed to kill and destroy all other species
are actually just 'kids' where they're having 'fun' without realizing what
they're doing is wrong. I feel like it has a good parallel with thinking the
enemy as 'pure evil' when it's much more a matter of perspective.


I love that even after everything done and they 'won', Jake still has issues
thinking about the Howler he had to kill.

Also, Ax having to deal with running away from a battle really shaking him up
that he wasn't being a 'brave warrior' is a nice touch.

**Nothing is as simple as it seems**
