***You can really feel the direness and loneliness Cassie has to do in literally trying to save everyone***

As you can tell from the book cover, Cassie actually morphs into a Yerk to save
Aftran. You learn that at least one human has befriended their Yerk parasite to
resist against the Yerk attempt at domination. It's actually kind of sweet I
think.

At the same time, you feel the desperation of Cassie as she tries to plan a rescue
and battle plan while also trying to save Ax's life by performing brain surgery.
Cassie's narration seems to focus on empathy and this one feels like she really
has it rough. You can see the struggle Cassie has to do in being in 'soldier 
mode'.

I love the resolution that they have for freeing Aftran which was to have them
morph into a dolphin forever. It feels right considering that the non-violent
solution is what happens. It really feels like a real Cassie story.


**Love that the Aftran gets morphing powers even if it means staying as a dolphin. Foreshadowing...**
