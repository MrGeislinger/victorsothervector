**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
This was a little wacky even for the Animorphs with shrinking and a new alien
species.
Definitely one of those that seems like it could be skipped.
(But maybe it becomes relevant later?)

***Honey I Shrunk the Animorphs***

Feels like a weaker one of the books probably because it's a little sci-fi
shrinking and stuff but no deeper themes. Still, not a bad one.


**Little details about shrinking and Helmacrons but nothing that seems important to remember**
