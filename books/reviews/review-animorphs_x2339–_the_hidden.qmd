***I couldn't stop chuckling at the ridiculousness***

Has to be the weirdest one yet. A water buffalo gains morphing power– it morphs into a human & Visser Three, an Andalite alien. Was laughing & thinking 'what the hell' a lot– still looked at animal rights presented by Cassie as narrator

**This makes no sense how easy it was for an ant to be able to morph**
