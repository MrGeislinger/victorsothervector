**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
Marco narrates the team going to underwater a Yerk facility to create 
smarter sharks so the Yerks can take over an amphibious psychic alien
species. The find Marco's mother controlled by a top Yerk leading the
effort there.

***Really exploring the whole "let's control animals" from the last book***

Of all the ridiculous parts of this book, the one that bothered me is that 
Marco has just casually showed himself to Visser One (Marco's mom
controlled by a Yerk). Then on top of that a psychic Leeran-controller saw
that Marco was human but not clear if that Yerk survived to tell Visser One
they aren't all Andalites.

**I know it feels silly to focus on it, but it's wild that they just exposed themselves to Visser One.**
