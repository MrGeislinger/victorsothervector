**Overview** <br/>
<br/>
The team discovers that two other Andalites have been surviving & hiding out on Earth.
One has a deadly degenerative genetic disease and the other is 'disabled' (no tail) &
can't morph.
<br/>

***Definitely would have been a two male, romantic relationship in a different era***

This definitely opens up extra questions like did they not receive Ax's distress
signal in *[Animorphs #8: The Alien](https://www.victorsothervector.com/books/book-animorphs%E2%80%93_x2308_the_alien.html)*.
Maybe the choose to ignore it XD

But now as we read, we know for sure these two Andalites are just chilling out
in suburbia. But also one chooses not to become human because 'honor'/'shame'.

**This is a bit weird one to have & also be narrated by Marco**
