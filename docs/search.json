Animals move with astounding grace, speed, and versatility: how do they do it, and what can we learn from them? In How to Walk on Water and Climb up Walls, David Hu takes readers on an accessible, wondrous journey into the world of animal motion. From basement labs at MIT to the rain forests of Panama, Hu shows how animals have adapted and evolved to traverse their environments, taking advantage of physical laws with results that are startling and ingenious. In turn, the latest discoveries about animal mechanics are inspiring scientists to invent robots and devices that move with similar elegance and efficiency. Hu follows scientists as they investigate a multitude of animal movements, from the undulations of sandfish and the way that dogs shake off water in fractions of a second to the seemingly crash-resistant characteristics of insect flight. Not limiting his exploration to individual organisms, Hu describes the ways animals enact swarm intelligence, such as when army ants cooperate and link their bodies to create bridges that span ravines. He also looks at what scientists learn from nature’s unexpected feats–such as snakes that fly, mosquitoes that survive rainstorms, and dead fish that swim upstream. As researchers better understand such issues as energy, flexibility, and water repellency in animal movement, they are applying this knowledge to the development of cutting-edge technology. Integrating biology, engineering, physics, and robotics, [this book] demystifies the remarkable mechanics behind animal locomotion”–Page 4 of cover.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

    "text": "Thoughts on How to Read a Book Revised and Updated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   This was an interesting book to read in a few ways. First was that the ‘revised & updated’ edition was updated in the 1970s from the 1940s book, so it had me wondering how much advice the book gives is now ‘common knowledge’. The other interesting aspect for me (which might be related to my earlier point) is how much of the techniques and strategies described are things I already do! But overall, I think this book was worth reading in that it at least had me thinknig more about how I read & what I want to read.   Buy at Bookshop (non-affiliate link / affiliate link)\n\n\n\nI couldn’t help but think about this book in how it fits in with a world 50 years after it was ‘revised’.\nIt was funny to read in the introduction from the 1970s on how TV & radio are becoming more prevalent and reflecting how much more there is in the modern world.\nAs I read, I could see snippets of what seems to be presented as a ‘new’ way approach to reading (beyond what is taught in school & university) that have been incorporated in my learning from the (relative) modern age. One big aspect was what I was told as ‘talking to the text’ which was repeated over and over again when going through grade school. But there was other advice that I know has been said to me in the past but I can almost guarantee is rarely followed, such as ‘skimming’ or ‘pre-reading’.\nThere were some frankly laughable parts that I either felt was obvious or even outdated such as the section on ‘How to Use a Dictionary’. There were also parts that I felt less inclined to follow for myself such as being dilligent in taking notes on a sections to reference later.\nA lot of the techniques described really fits well with trying to use books as research towards an overarching goal.\nThe steps detailed basically can be summarized to be:\n\nElementary Reading: Basically reading for understanding\nInspectional Reading: Skimming & pre-reading to determine what the book is about (and if it’s worth reading for your ‘goal’)\nAnalytical Reading: Understanding the book as a whole and the arguments it presents and how convinced you are of them\nSyntopical Reading: Taking in multiple references to broaden & deepen knowledge in the area\n\n\nThere was a lot that I discovered I already do such as varying my speed while reading a book to focus on the ‘important’/‘relevant’ parts. I actually think some of the techniques could be revised to something like ‘How to Watch a Video’.\nI don’t feel like this was a ‘mind-blowing’ read, but at least for me it has me reflecting on how I want to approach future reading. In the past, I’ve grouped books to read together based on subject and even read some simulataneously. This ‘How to Read a Book’ has me thinking about maybe trying out doing almost a ‘research’ read. One thing that comes to mind is maybe trying to read philosophy as if it was part of a class. (I always wanted to do more humanities like that while at university but never found the time.)\n‘How to Read a Book’ can be refreshing in just having you reflect what you want to get out of your reading."

Hopes that the Internet might bring people together have been crushed by the ills of social media. Is there a way back? As head of TED, Chris Anderson has had a ringside view of the world’s boldest thinkers sharing their most uplifting ideas. Inspired by them, he believes that it’s within our grasp to turn outrage back into optimism. It all comes down to reimagining one of the most fundamental human virtues: generosity. What if generosity could become infectious generosity? Consider • how a London barber began offering haircuts to people experiencing homelessness—and catalyzed a movement • how two anonymous donors gave $10,000 each to two hundred strangers and discovered that most recipients wanted to “pay it forward” with their own generous acts • how TED itself transformed from a niche annual summit into a global beacon of ideas by giving away talks online, allowing millions access to free learning In telling these inspiring stories, Anderson has given us “the first page-turner ever written about human generosity” (Elizabeth Dunn). More important, he offers a playbook for how to embark on our own generous acts—whether gifts of money, time, talent, connection, or kindness—and to prime them, thanks to the Internet, to have self-replicating, even world-changing, impact.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Especially since it’s narrated by the only alien in the group who can technically be impartial to common practices done on Earth.\nAs you might expect, Cassie and Marco are on the opposite ends of the spectrum. The book clearly leans towards Cassie’s view that animals deserve our respect even if they aren’t fully sentient, but especially so. Marco has a much more direct “but they’re animals” attitude and is more than willing to accept animal harm if it’s especially inconvenient to their goals to prevent it. Ax, the narrator, represent the neutral voice and debate that we as human society has on where we draw lines.\nInteresting to see the book go from debating about whether they should save the chimpanzees in the lab to where the team is in a situation of deciding to free some humans in cages. Definitely tries to draw parallels in a relatively straight-forward fashion that a young teen might connect the dots.\nThis book overall doesn’t really progress the story (or at least I don’t see how it will). This being another ghost writer story, I’m seeing that these tend to be relatively self-contained. And I don’t know if it’s because we’re about 30 books into the series or because this was a ghost writer, but the beginning feels particularly rushed in explaining the Animorphs (as they do every book).\nI’ll probably not try and look at which are by ghost writters since I catch myself thinking about that more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project—this epic work details the science, the people, and the sociopolitical realities that led to the development of the atomic bomb. This sweeping account begins in the 19th century, with the discovery of nuclear fission, and continues to World War Two and the Americans’ race to beat Hitler’s Nazis. That competition launched the Manhattan Project and the nearly overnight construction of a vast military-industrial complex that culminated in the fateful dropping of the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Reading like a character-driven suspense novel, the book introduces the players in this saga of physics, politics, and human psychology—from FDR and Einstein to the visionary scientists who pioneered quantum theory and the application of thermonuclear fission, including Planck, Szilard, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Fermi, Teller, Meitner, von Neumann, and Lawrence. From nuclear power’s earliest foreshadowing in the work of H.G. Wells to the bright glare of Trinity at Alamogordo and the arms race of the Cold War, this dread invention forever changed the course of human history, and The Making of The Atomic Bomb provides a panoramic backdrop for that story. Richard Rhodes’s ability to craft compelling biographical portraits is matched only by his rigorous scholarship.

    "text": "Thoughts on Doing Good Better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   Most of us want to make a difference. We donate our time and money to charities and causes we deem worthy, choose careers we consider meaningful, and patronize businesses and buy products we believe make the world a better place. Unfortunately, we often base these decisions on assumptions and emotions rather than facts. As a result, even our best intentions often lead to ineffective—and sometimes downright harmful—outcomes. How can we do better? While a researcher at Oxford, trying to figure out which career would allow him to have the greatest impact, William MacAskill confronted this problem head on. He discovered that much of the potential for change was being squandered by lack of information, bad data, and our own prejudice. As an antidote, he and his colleagues developed effective altruism, a practical, data-driven approach that allows each of us to make a tremendous difference regardless of our resources. Effective altruists believe that it’s not enough to simply do good; we must do good better. At the core of this philosophy are five key questions that help guide our altruistic decisions: How many people benefit, and by how much? Is this the most effective thing I can do? Is this area neglected? What would have happened otherwise? What are the chances of success, and how good would success be? By applying these questions to real-life scenarios, MacAskill shows how many of our assumptions about doing good are misguided. For instance, he argues one can potentially save more lives by becoming a plastic surgeon rather than a heart surgeon; measuring overhead costs is an inaccurate gauge of a charity’s effectiveness; and, it generally doesn’t make sense for individuals to donate to disaster relief. MacAskill urges us to think differently, set aside biases, and use evidence and careful reasoning rather than act on impulse. When we do this—when we apply the head and the heart to each of our altruistic endeavors—we find that each of us has the power to do an astonishing amount of good.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Buy at Bookshop (non-affiliate link / affiliate link)\n\n\n\nI don’t know how I avoided hearing anything about this book (published in 1989) but I’m glad I wasn’t spoiled!\nI’m not a big reader of fiction, but I do tend to like a good Sci-Fi world, and Hyperion delivers!\nI can’t actually remember who recommended the book or where I even heard about it first, but it’s been on my reading list for a while now. I enjoy going into books blind as much as possible and that’s how I went into this one. I wasn’t sure if it was science fiction. I suggest the same to you if you’re reading this, so here’s your chance before continuing. (It’s not like my thoughts on the book are that profound anyways.)\n\nI was so happy going into the book with no expectations since this book unveils the world of Hyperion little-by-little over stories from 6 different travelers. This ~500 page book really is more of an introduction to a world that apparently kicks off the 4 part series. This can sound like a bit of a rip but I find these 6 stories broken into their own chapters and averaging about 80 pages stand well on their own while also building up more of the fictional world.\nI usually read by chapter where I dedicate the time to finish a complete chapter at a time, and this book works really well for my method! With the longest chapters being 100 pages, it’s something I could dedicate about 60-90 minutes to completely focus on one story at a time.\nThe sci-fi concepts from the book are interesting such as having to deal with time dilation but for the most part the concepts feel more like ‘magic’ than something I feel grounded in our own universe. But I think that’s alright since the main focus is about the world and this mysterious ‘Shrike’ who’s to bring the end of humanity & is traveling backwards in time. The important part is that it feels as if there are rules to this universe and we’re trying to understand how the characters and events are connected.\nSpeaking of the ‘traveling backwards through time’, some stories/chapters resonated with me more than others and it was the “The Scholar’s Tale” with Sol’s daughter Rachel aging backwards that hit me hard. This definitely feels like something I connect more with as a parent compared to if I read this when I was younger without kids. The way the story is told is heartbreaking with a dagger on my heartstrings being twisted throughout the chapter. I’m honestly a little afraid, though still intrigued, to hear about what ultimately happens. If you read this before having kids and are a parent now, I bet it’s worth reading again for that different emotional experience.\nI liked Hyperion’s style of the world being revealed through multiple characters’ backstories; the author, Dan Simmons, does a great job of making each feel like it is actually told by someone different. I don’t know what the rest of the series will be like (I’ve heard it’s not told in the same multiple perspectives) but this was good enough that it has me dedicated to get through the rest of the series to see what happens!\nI had to ask my public library to request the sequel from another library so I guess I’m too far invested now to quit.\nHyperion has got me hooked, so even if the rest of the series is different, I’m still looking forward to Dan Simmons writing on what happens next!"

Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field’s key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics. Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning’s relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson’s wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

While seemingly harmless, the question has unintended consequences. It can make you feel like you need to choose one job, one passion, one thing to be about. Guess what? You don’t. Having a lot of different interests, projects and curiosities doesn’t make you a “jack-of-all-trades, master of none.” Your endless curiosity doesn’t mean you are broken or flaky. What you are is a multipotentialite: someone with many interests and creative pursuits. And that is actually your biggest strength. How to Be Everything helps you channel your diverse passions and skills to work for you. Based on her popular TED talk, “Why some of us don’t have one true calling”, Emilie Wapnick flips the script on conventional career advice. Instead of suggesting that you specialize, choose a niche or accumulate 10,000 hours of practice in a single area, Wapnick provides a practical framework for building a sustainable life around ALL of your passions. You’ll discover: • Why your multipotentiality is your biggest strength, especially in today’s uncertain job market. • How to make a living and structure your work if you have many skills and interests. • How to focus on multiple projects and make progress on all of them. • How to handle common insecurities such as the fear of not being the best, the guilt associated with losing interest in something you used to love and the challenge of explaining “what you do” to others. Not fitting neatly into a box can be a beautiful thing. How to Be Everything teaches you how to design a life, at any age and stage of your career, that allows you to be fully you, and find the kind of work you’ll love.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Math is boring, says the mathematician and comedian Matt Parker. Part of the problem may be the way the subject is taught, but it’s also true that we all, to a greater or lesser extent, find math difficult and counterintuitive. This counterintuitiveness is actually part of the point, argues Parker: the extraordinary thing about math is that it allows us to access logic and ideas beyond what our brains can instinctively do—through its logical tools we are able to reach beyond our innate abilities and grasp more and more abstract concepts. In the absorbing and exhilarating Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension, Parker sets out to convince his readers to revisit the very math that put them off the subject as fourteen-year-olds. Starting with the foundations of math familiar from school (numbers, geometry, and algebra), he reveals how it is possible to climb all the way up to the topology and to four-dimensional shapes, and from there to infinity—and slightly beyond. Both playful and sophisticated, Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension is filled with captivating games and puzzles, a buffet of optional hands-on activities that entices us to take pleasure in math that is normally only available to those studying at a university level. Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension invites us to re-learn much of what we missed in school and, this time, to be utterly enthralled by it.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

GOOD MORNING AMERICA BOOK CLUB PICK • PEOPLE’S BOOK OF THE WEEK • A POPSUGAR BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR Olivia McAfee knows what it feels like to start over. Her picture-perfect life—living in Boston, married to a brilliant cardiothoracic surgeon, raising their beautiful son, Asher—was upended when her husband revealed a darker side. She never imagined that she would end up back in her sleepy New Hampshire hometown, living in the house she grew up in and taking over her father’s beekeeping business. Lily Campanello is familiar with do-overs, too. When she and her mom relocate to Adams, New Hampshire, for her final year of high school, they both hope it will be a fresh start. And for just a short while, these new beginnings are exactly what Olivia and Lily need. Their paths cross when Asher falls for the new girl in school, and Lily can’t help but fall for him, too. With Ash, she feels happy for the first time. Yet she wonders if she can trust him completely. . . . Then one day, Olivia receives a phone call: Lily is dead, and Asher is being questioned by the police. Olivia is adamant that her son is innocent. But she would be lying if she didn’t acknowledge the flashes of his father’s temper in Ash, and as the case against him unfolds, she realizes he’s hidden more than he’s shared with her.

It will gladden the hearts of writers and artists everywhere, and get them working again with a new sense of meaning and direction. A stunning accomplishment.” —Anne Lamott From the legendary music producer, a master at helping people connect with the wellsprings of their creativity, comes a beautifully crafted book many years in the making that offers that same deep wisdom to all of us. “I set out to write a book about what to do to make a great work of art. Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be.” —Rick Rubin Many famed music producers are known for a particular sound that has its day. Rick Rubin is known for something else: creating a space where artists of all different genres and traditions can home in on who they really are and what they really offer. He has made a practice of helping people transcend their self-imposed expectations in order to reconnect with a state of innocence from which the surprising becomes inevitable. Over the years, as he has thought deeply about where creativity comes from and where it doesn’t, he has learned that being an artist isn’t about your specific output, it’s about your relationship to the world. Creativity has a place in everyone’s life, and everyone can make that place larger. In fact, there are few more important responsibilities. The Creative Act is a beautiful and generous course of study that illuminates the path of the artist as a road we all can follow. It distills the wisdom gleaned from a lifetime’s work into a luminous reading experience that puts the power to create moments—and lifetimes—of exhilaration and transcendence within closer reach for all of us.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

    "text": "Thoughts on Pests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   From tenements to alleyways to latrines, twentieth-century American cities created spaces where pests flourished and people struggled for healthy living conditions. In Pests in the City, Dawn Day Biehler argues that the urban ecologies that supported pests were shaped not only by the physical features of cities but also by social inequalities, housing policies, and ideas about domestic space. Community activists and social reformers strived to control pests in cities such as Washington, DC, Chicago, Baltimore, New York, and Milwaukee, but such efforts fell short when authorities blamed families and neighborhood culture for infestations rather than attacking racial segregation or urban disinvestment. Pest-control campaigns tended to target public or private spaces, but pests and pesticides moved readily across the porous boundaries between homes and neighborhoods. This story of flies, bedbugs, cockroaches, and rats reveals that such creatures thrived on lax code enforcement and the marginalization of the poor, immigrants, and people of color. As Biehler shows, urban pests have remained a persistent problem at the intersection of public health, politics, and environmental justice, even amid promises of modernity and sustainability in American cities.

    "text": "Thoughts on Mathematical Intelligence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   A fresh exploration into the ‘human nature versus technology’ argument, revealing an unexpected advantage that humans have over our future robot masters: we’re actually good at mathematics. There’s so much discussion about the threat posed by intelligent machines that it sometimes seems as though we should simply surrender to our robot overlords now. But Junaid Mubeen isn’t ready to throw in the towel just yet. As far as he is concerned, we have the creative edge over computers, because of a remarkable system of thought that humans have developed over the millennia. It’s familiar to us all, but often badly taught in schools and misrepresented in popular discourse—math. Computers are, of course, brilliant at totting up sums, pattern-seeking, and performing mindless tasks of, well, computation. For all things calculation, machines reign supreme. But Junaid identifies seven areas of intelligence where humans can retain a crucial edge. And in exploring these areas, he opens up a fascinating world where we can develop our uniquely human mathematical talents. Just a few of the fascinating subjects covered in MATHEMATICAL INTELLIGENCE include: -Humans are endowed with a natural sense of numbers that is based on approximation rather than precise calculation. Our in-built estimation skills complement the precision of computers. Interpreting the real world depends on both. -What sets humans apart from other animals is language and abstraction. We have an extraordinary ability to create powerful representations of knowledge— more diverse than the binary language of computers. -Mathematics confers the most robust, logical framework for establishing permanent truths. Reasoning shields us from the dubious claims of pure pattern-recognition systems. -All mathematical truths are derived from a starting set of assumptions, or axioms. Unlike computers, humans have the freedom to break free of convention and examine the logical consequences of our choices. Mathematics rewards our imagination with fascinating and, on occasion, applicable concepts that originate from breaking the rules. -Computers can be tasked to solve a range of problems, but which problems are worth the effort? Questioning is as vital to our repertoire of thinking skills as problem-solving itself.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Today we think statistics are the enemy, numbers used to mislead and confuse us. That’s a mistake, Tim Harford says in The Data Detective. We shouldn’t be suspicious of statistics—we need to understand what they mean and how they can improve our lives: they are, at heart, human behavior seen through the prism of numbers and are often “the only way of grasping much of what is going on around us.” If we can toss aside our fears and learn to approach them clearly—understanding how our own preconceptions lead us astray—statistics can point to ways we can live better and work smarter. As “perhaps the best popular economics writer in the world” (New Statesman), Tim Harford is an expert at taking complicated ideas and untangling them for millions of readers. In The Data Detective, he uses new research in science and psychology to set out ten strategies for using statistics to erase our biases and replace them with new ideas that use virtues like patience, curiosity, and good sense to better understand ourselves and the world. As a result, The Data Detective is a big-idea book about statistics and human behavior that is fresh, unexpected, and insightful.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

It’s as simple, and as ambitious, as that.” —Ezra Klein An Oxford philosopher makes the case for “longtermism” — that positively influencing the long-term future is a key moral priority of our time. The fate of the world is in our hands. Humanity’s written history spans only five thousand years. Our yet-unwritten future could last for millions more — or it could end tomorrow. Astonishing numbers of people could lead lives of great happiness or unimaginable suffering, or never live at all, depending on what we choose to do today. In What We Owe The Future, philosopher William MacAskill argues for longtermism, that idea that positively influencing the distant future is a key moral priority of our time. From this perspective, it’s not enough to reverse climate change or avert the next pandemic. We must ensure that civilization would rebound if it collapsed; counter the end of moral progress; and prepare for a planet where the smartest beings are digital, not human. If we make wise choices today, our grandchildren’s grandchildren will thrive, knowing we did everything we could to give them a world full of justice, hope and beauty.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

    "text": "Thoughts on The Ascent of Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   “Full of fascinating insights drawn from an impressive range of disciplines, The Ascent of Information casts the familiar and the foreign in a dramatic new light.” —Brian Greene, author of The Elegant Universe Your information has a life of its own, and it’s using you to get what it wants. One of the most peculiar and possibly unique features of humans is the vast amount of information we carry outside our biological selves. But in our rush to build the infrastructure for the 20 quintillion bits we create every day, we’ve failed to ask exactly why we’re expending ever-increasing amounts of energy, resources, and human effort to maintain all this data. Drawing on deep ideas and frontier thinking in evolutionary biology, computer science, information theory, and astrobiology, Caleb Scharf argues that information is, in a very real sense, alive. All the data we create—all of our emails, tweets, selfies, A.I.-generated text and funny cat videos—amounts to an aggregate lifeform. It has goals and needs. It can control our behavior and influence our well-being. And it’s an organism that has evolved right alongside us. This symbiotic relationship with information offers a startling new lens for looking at the world. Data isn’t just something we produce; it’s the reason we exist. This powerful idea has the potential to upend the way we think about our technology, our role as humans, and the fundamental nature of life. The Ascent of Information offers a humbling vision of a universe built of and for information. Scharf explores how our relationship with data will affect our ongoing evolution as a species. Understanding this relationship will be crucial to preventing our data from becoming more of a burden than an asset, and to preserving the possibility of a human future.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

With this book, you’ll learn how to solve statistical problems with Python code instead of mathematical formulas, using discrete probability distributions rather than continuous mathematics. Once you get the math out of the way, the Bayesian fundamentals will become clearer and you’ll begin to apply these techniques to real-world problems. Bayesian statistical methods are becoming more common and more important, but there aren’t many resources available to help beginners. Based on undergraduate classes taught by author Allen B. Downey, this book’s computational approach helps you get a solid start. Use your programming skills to learn and understand Bayesian statistics Work with problems involving estimation, prediction, decision analysis, evidence, and Bayesian hypothesis testing Get started with simple examples, using coins, dice, and a bowl of cookies Learn computational methods for solving real-world problems  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

    "text": "Thoughts on 80000 Hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   Most of us want to make a difference. We donate our time and money to charities and causes we deem worthy, choose careers we consider meaningful, and patronize businesses and buy products we believe make the world a better place. Unfortunately, we often base these decisions on assumptions and emotions rather than facts. As a result, even our best intentions often lead to ineffective—and sometimes downright harmful—outcomes. How can we do better? While a researcher at Oxford, trying to figure out which career would allow him to have the greatest impact, William MacAskill confronted this problem head on. He discovered that much of the potential for change was being squandered by lack of information, bad data, and our own prejudice. As an antidote, he and his colleagues developed effective altruism, a practical, data-driven approach that allows each of us to make a tremendous difference regardless of our resources. Effective altruists believe that it’s not enough to simply do good; we must do good better. At the core of this philosophy are five key questions that help guide our altruistic decisions: How many people benefit, and by how much? Is this the most effective thing I can do? Is this area neglected? What would have happened otherwise? What are the chances of success, and how good would success be? By applying these questions to real-life scenarios, MacAskill shows how many of our assumptions about doing good are misguided. For instance, he argues one can potentially save more lives by becoming a plastic surgeon rather than a heart surgeon; measuring overhead costs is an inaccurate gauge of a charity’s effectiveness; and, it generally doesn’t make sense for individuals to donate to disaster relief. MacAskill urges us to think differently, set aside biases, and use evidence and careful reasoning rather than act on impulse. When we do this—when we apply the head and the heart to each of our altruistic endeavors—we find that each of us has the power to do an astonishing amount of good.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

    "text": "Thoughts on Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   The instant New York Times bestseller “Excellent…Outstanding for its breadth of research, the liveliness of the writing, and the depth of humanity it conveys.” – Wall Street Journal One of our great behavioral scientists, the bestselling author of Behave, plumbs the depths of the science and philosophy of decision-making to mount a devastating case against free will, an argument with profound consequences Robert Sapolsky’s Behave, his now classic account of why humans do good and why they do bad, pointed toward an unsettling conclusion: We may not grasp the precise marriage of nature and nurture that creates the physics and chemistry at the base of human behavior, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Now, in Determined, Sapolsky takes his argument all the way, mounting a brilliant (and in his inimitable way, delightful) full-frontal assault on the pleasant fantasy that there is some separate self telling our biology what to do. Determined offers a marvelous synthesis of what we know about how consciousness works—the tight weave between reason and emotion and between stimulus and response in the moment and over a life. One by one, Sapolsky tackles all the major arguments for free will and takes them out, cutting a path through the thickets of chaos and complexity science and quantum physics, as well as touching ground on some of the wilder shores of philosophy. He shows us that the history of medicine is in no small part the history of learning that fewer and fewer things are somebody’s “fault”; for example, for centuries we thought seizures were a sign of demonic possession. Yet, as he acknowledges, it’s very hard, and at times impossible, to uncouple from our zeal to judge others and to judge ourselves. Sapolsky applies the new understanding of life beyond free will to some of our most essential questions around punishment, morality, and living well together. By the end, Sapolsky argues that while living our daily lives recognizing that we have no free will is going to be monumentally difficult, doing so is not going to result in anarchy, pointlessness, and existential malaise. Instead, it will make for a much more humane world.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Signed edition Tuberculosis has been entwined with hu­manity for millennia. Once romanticized as a malady of poets, today tuberculosis is seen as a disease of poverty that walks the trails of injustice and inequity we blazed for it. In 2019, author John Green met Henry Reider, a young tuberculosis patient at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. John be­came fast friends with Henry, a boy with spindly legs and a big, goofy smile. In the years since that first visit to Lakka, Green has become a vocal advocate for increased access to treatment and wider awareness of the healthcare inequi­ties that allow this curable, preventable infec­tious disease to also be the deadliest, killing over a million people every year. In Everything Is Tuberculosis, John tells Henry’s story, woven through with the scientific and social histories of how tuberculosis has shaped our world—and how our choices will shape the future of tuberculosis.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

This book will guide you through the technical, legal, and ethical aspects of making your code fair and secure while highlighting cutting edge academic research and ongoing legal developments related to fairness and algorithms. There is mounting evidence that the widespread deployment of machine learning and artificial intelligence in business and government is reproducing the same biases we are trying to fight in the real world. For this reason, fairness is an increasingly important consideration for the data scientist. Yet discussions of what fairness means in terms of actual code are few and far between.

With a philoso­pher’s sense of inquiry, Auerbach recounts his childhood spent drawing ferns with the pro­gramming language Logo on the Apple IIe, his adventures in early text-based video games, his education as an engineer, and his contribu­tions to instant messaging technology devel­oped for Microsoft and the servers powering Google’s data stores. A lifelong student of the systems that shape our lives—from the psy­chiatric taxonomy of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to how Facebook tracks and profiles its users—Auerbach reflects on how he has experienced the algorithms that taxonomize human speech, knowledge, and behavior and that compel us to do the same. Into this exquisitely crafted, wide-ranging memoir of a life spent with code, Auerbach has woven an eye-opening and searing examina­tion of the inescapable ways in which algo­rithms have both standardized and coarsened our lives. As we engineer ever more intricate technology to translate our experiences and narrow the gap that divides us from the ma­chine, Auerbach argues, we willingly erase our nuances and our idiosyncrasies—precisely the things that make us human.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Learn a new talent, stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way. Ultralearning offers nine principles to master hard skills quickly. This is the essential guide to future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage through self-education. In these tumultuous times of economic and technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education—a lifelong mastery of fresh ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner. The challenge of learning new skills is that you think you already know how best to learn, as you did as a student, so you rerun old routines and old ways of solving problems. To counter that, Ultralearning offers powerful strategies to break you out of those mental ruts and introduces new training methods to help you push through to higher levels of retention. Scott H. Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself—among them Benjamin Franklin, chess grandmaster Judit Polgár, and Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymath Nigel Richards, who won the French World Scrabble Championship—without knowing French. Young documents the methods he and others have used to acquire knowledge and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares a proven framework for a successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and exe - cute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs. Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple tools to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

This extensive anthology allows readers to peer into the mind of genius by providing them with excerpts from the original mathematical proofs and results. It also helps them understand the progression of mathematical thought, and the very foundations of our present-day technologies. Each chapter begins with a biography of the featured mathematician, clearly explaining the significance of the result, followed by the full proof of the work, reproduced from the original publication.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

But every kind of animal, including humans, is enclosed within its own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of our immense world. In An Immense World, Ed Yong coaxes us beyond the confines of our own senses, allowing us to perceive the skeins of scent, waves of electromagnetism, and pulses of pressure that surround us. We encounter beetles that are drawn to fires, turtles that can track the Earth’s magnetic fields, fish that fill rivers with electrical messages, and even humans who wield sonar like bats. We discover that a crocodile’s scaly face is as sensitive as a lover’s fingertips, that the eyes of a giant squid evolved to see sparkling whales, that plants thrum with the inaudible songs of courting bugs, and that even simple scallops have complex vision. We learn what bees see in flowers, what songbirds hear in their tunes, and what dogs smell on the street. We listen to stories of pivotal discoveries in the field, while looking ahead at the many mysteries that remain unsolved. Funny, rigorous, and suffused with the joy of discovery, An Immense World takes us on what Marcel Proust called “the only true voyage . . . not to visit strange lands, but to possess other eyes.” WINNER OF THE ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL • FINALIST FOR THE KIRKUS PRIZE • FINALIST FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD • LONGLISTED FOR THE PEN/E.O.

    "text": "Thoughts on Seveneves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Anathem, Reamde, and Cryptonomicon comes an exciting and thought-provoking science fiction epic—a grand story of annihilation and survival spanning five thousand years. What would happen if the world were ending? A catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb. In a feverish race against the inevitable, nations around the globe band together to devise an ambitious plan to ensure the survival of humanity far beyond our atmosphere, in outer space. But the complexities and unpredictability of human nature coupled with unforeseen challenges and dangers threaten the intrepid pioneers, until only a handful of survivors remain . . . Five thousand years later, their progeny—seven distinct races now three billion strong—embark on yet another audacious journey into the unknown . . . to an alien world utterly transformed by cataclysm and time: Earth. A writer of dazzling genius and imaginative vision, Neal Stephenson combines science, philosophy, technology, psychology, and literature in a magnificent work of speculative fiction that offers a portrait of a future that is both extraordinary and eerily recognizable. As he did in Anathem, Cryptonomicon, the Baroque Cycle, and Reamde, Stephenson explores some of our biggest ideas and perplexing challenges in a breathtaking saga that is daring, engrossing, and altogether brilliant.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Some of the challenges and barriers to operationalization are technical, but others are organizational. Either way, the bottom line is that models not in production can’t provide business impact. This book introduces the key concepts of MLOps to help data scientists and application engineers not only operationalize ML models to drive real business change but also maintain and improve those models over time. Through lessons based on numerous MLOps applications around the world, nine experts in machine learning provide insights into the five steps of the model life cycle–Build, Preproduction, Deployment, Monitoring, and Governance–uncovering how robust MLOps processes can be infused throughout. This book helps you: Fulfill data science value by reducing friction throughout ML pipelines and workflows Refine ML models through retraining, periodic tuning, and complete remodeling to ensure long-term accuracy Design the MLOps life cycle to minimize organizational risks with models that are unbiased, fair, and explainable Operationalize ML models for pipeline deployment and for external business systems that are more complex and less standardized  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

If you’re a data scientist or coder, this practical book -now revised in full color- shows you how to train and scale these large models using Hugging Face Transformers, a Python-based deep learning library. Transformers have been used to write realistic news stories, improve Google Search queries, and even create chatbots that tell corny jokes. In this guide, authors Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf, among the creators of Hugging Face Transformers, use a hands-on approach to teach you how transformers work and how to integrate them in your applications. You’ll quickly learn a variety of tasks they can help you solve. Build, debug, and optimize transformer models for core NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering Learn how transformers can be used for cross-lingual transfer learning Apply transformers in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce Make transformer models efficient for deployment using techniques such as distillation, pruning, and quantization Train transformers from scratch and learn how to scale to multiple GPUs and distributed environments  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Science isn’t easy, but in Munroe’s capable hands, it surely can be fun.” —TIME The #1 New York Times bestselling author of What If? and How To answers more of the weirdest questions you never thought to ask The millions of people around the world who read and loved What If? still have questions, and those questions are getting stranger. Thank goodness xkcd creator Randall Munroe is here to help. Planning to ride a fire pole from the Moon back to Earth? The hardest part is sticking the landing. Hoping to cool the atmosphere by opening everyone’s freezer door at the same time? Maybe it’s time for a brief introduction to thermodynamics. Want to know what would happen if you rode a helicopter blade, built a billion-story building, made a lava lamp out of lava, or jumped on a geyser as it erupted? Okay, if you insist. Before you go on a cosmic road trip, feed the residents of New York City to a T. rex, or fill every church with bananas, be sure to consult this practical guide for impractical ideas. Unfazed by absurdity, Munroe consults the latest research on everything from swing-set physics to airliner catapult–design to answer his readers’ questions, clearly and concisely, with illuminating and occasionally terrifying illustrations. As he consistently demonstrates, you can learn a lot from examining how the world might work in very specific extreme circumstances.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein * More than 2 million copies sold * New York Times bestseller Since the original publication of Nudge more than a decade ago, the title has entered the vocabulary of businesspeople, policy makers, engaged citizens, and consumers everywhere. The book has given rise to more than 400 “nudge units” in governments around the world and countless groups of behavioral scientists in every part of the economy. It has taught us how to use thoughtful “choice architecture”—a concept the authors invented—to help us make better decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society. Now, the authors have rewritten the book from cover to cover, making use of their experiences in and out of government over the past dozen years as well as an explosion of new research in numerous academic disciplines. To commit themselves to never undertaking this daunting task again, they are calling this the “final edition.” It offers a wealth of new insights, for both its avowed fans and newcomers to the field, about a wide variety of issues that we face in our daily lives—COVID-19, health, personal finance, retirement savings, credit card debt, home mortgages, medical care, organ donation, climate change, and “sludge” (paperwork and other nuisances we don’t want, and that keep us from getting what we do want)—all while honoring one of the cardinal rules of nudging: make it fun!  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

    "text": "Thoughts on The Infinite Gift\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   A child’s very first word is a miraculous sound, the opening note in a lifelong symphony. Most parents never forget the moment. But that first word is soon followed by a second and a third, and by the age of three, children are typically learning ten new words every day and speaking in complete sentences. The process seems effortless, and for children, it is. But how exactly does it happen? How do children learn language? And why is it so much harder to do later in life? Drawing on cutting-edge developments in biology, neurology, psychology, and linguistics, Charles Yang’s The Infinite Gift takes us inside the astonishingly complex but largely subconscious process by which children learn to talk and to understand the spoken word. Yang illuminates the rich mysteries of language: why French newborns already prefer the sound of French to English; why baby-talk, though often unintelligible, makes perfect linguistic sense; why babies born deaf still babble – but with their hands; why the grammars of some languages may be evolutionarily stronger than others; and why one of the brain’s earliest achievements may in fact be its most complex. Yang also puts forth an exciting new theory. Building on Noam Chomsky’s notion of a universal grammar – the idea that every human being is born with an intuitive grasp of grammar – Yang argues that we learn our native languages in part by unlearning the grammars of all the rest. This means that the next time you hear a child make a grammatical mistake, it may not be a mistake at all; his or her grammar may be perfectly correct in Chinese or Navajo or ancient Greek. This is the brain’s way of testing its options as it searches for the local and thus correct grammar – and then discards all the wrong ones. And we humans, Yang shows, are not the only creatures who learn this way. In fact, learning by unlearning may be an ancient evolutionary mechanism that runs throughout the animal kingdom. Thus, babies learn to talk in much the same way that birds learn to sing. Enlivened by Yang’s experiences with his own young son, The Infinite Gift is as charming as it is challenging, as thoughtful as it is thought-provoking. An absorbing read for parents, educators, and anyone who has ever wondered about the origins of that uniquely human gift: our ability to speak and, just as miraculous, to understand one another.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

    "text": "Thoughts on The Enigma of Reason\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   Science If reason is what makes us human, why do we behave so irrationally? And if it is so useful, why didn’t it evolve in other animals? This groundbreaking account of the evolution of reason by two renowned cognitive scientists seeks to solve this double enigma. Reason, they argue, helps us justify our beliefs, convince others, and evaluate arguments. It makes it easier to cooperate and communicate and to live together in groups. Provocative, entertaining, and undeniably relevant, The Enigma of Reason will make many reasonable people rethink their beliefs. By Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier.  \n\n\n\nWe suck at ‘reasoning’ because we have the wrong definition of ‘reasoning’\nDescribes ‘argumentative theory of reasoning’ which proposes we developed a method of giving reasons as an argument (a discussion). This leads to say that ‘reasoning’ is a social act and works best when done as a group. In short, people give lazy and biased reasons, while their evaluations are objective & demanding.\nI find this idea fascinating and likely to be closer to the truth in how we can ‘reason’ through logic. It actually describes the phenomenon where we get logic puzzles often wrong but then arrive to correct answers when working in a group. This would mean our ability of performing logic wasn’t the driving force in our evolution, but a side effect to give arguments as part of a group.\nIt might just be the time I’m reading this in, but my mind kept wandering over with the idea of ‘reasoning AI’. Strategies taken have mostly been either assuming logic & reason can be developed with structure & training (the model getting ‘smarter’) or using something like the concept of a ‘slow’ & ‘fast’ system of thinking (based Daniel Kahneman’s thesis in Thinking, Fast and Slow) by having the model perform ‘chain-of-thought reasoning’.\nTo me, a lot of the ‘argumentative theory of reasoning’ seems to present in many LLM models (especially without extensive modern fine-tuning) where the model will be confidently wrong and can end in a back-and-forth chat with a human spouting incorrect reasons. I wonder if the model was fine-tuned or even prompted with the expectation of a back-and-forth if it could do better on some of the tasks being consistent. This could emulate the idea of ‘social reasoning’ which Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier presented evidence in their book.\n\nThis was a great read that makes me really think (ironically)! I actually was reminded of this book from a VSauce video The Future of Reasoning which leans heavily on this book’s ideas. I think it’s worth a watch even if you don’t want to read the book!\nReasoning is more about using group discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

These modern architectures use new primitives that require a different set of practices than most developers, tech leads, and architects are accustomed to. With this focused guide, Bilgin Ibryam and Roland Huß from Red Hat provide common reusable elements, patterns, principles, and practices for designing and implementing cloud-native applications on Kubernetes. Each pattern includes a description of the problem and a proposed solution with Kubernetes specifics. Many patterns are also backed by concrete code examples. This book is ideal for developers already familiar with basic Kubernetes concepts who want to learn common cloud-native patterns. You’ll learn about the following pattern categories: Foundational patterns cover the core principles and practices for building container-based cloud-native applications. Behavioral patterns explore finer-grained concepts for managing various types of container and platform interactions. Structural patterns help you organize containers within a pod, the atom of the Kubernetes platform. Configuration patterns provide insight into how application configurations can be handled in Kubernetes. Advanced patterns cover more advanced topics such as extending the platform with operators.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

If you want joy, love, romance, and hope—read with us.” —Jenna Bush Hager A luminous, spirit-lifting blockbuster that asks: would you choose to find out the length of your life? Eight ordinary people. One extraordinary choice. It seems like any other day. You wake up, drink a cup of coffee, and head out. But today, when you open your front door, waiting for you is a small wooden box. The contents of this mysterious box tells you the exact number of years you will live. From suburban doorsteps to desert tents, every person on every continent receives the same box. In an instant, the world is thrust into a collective frenzy. Where did these boxes come from? What do they mean? Is there truth to what they promise? As society comes together and pulls apart, everyone faces the same shocking choice: Do they wish to know how long they’ll live? And, if so, what will they do with that knowledge? The Measure charts the dawn of this new world through an unforgettable cast of characters whose decisions and fates interweave with one another: best friends whose dreams are forever entwined, pen pals finding refuge in the unknown, a couple who thought they didn’t have to rush, a doctor who cannot save himself, and a politician whose box becomes the powder keg that ultimately changes everything.

Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent. Cheng Xin, an aerospace engineer from the early twenty-first century, awakens from hibernation in this new age. She brings with her knowledge of a long-forgotten program dating from the beginning of the Trisolar Crisis, and her very presence may upset the delicate balance between two worlds. Will humanity reach for the stars or die in its cradle? Death’s End is the New York Times bestselling conclusion to Cixin Liu’s tour-de-force series that began with The Three-Body Problem. “The War of the Worlds for the twenty-first century . . .

What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between one programmed to save as many lives as possible and another that prioritizes the lives of its own passengers? And would you agree to share your family’s full medical history if you were told that it would help researchers find a cure for cancer? These are just some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as we approach the age of the algorithm, when it feels as if the machines reign supreme. Already, these lines of code are telling us what to watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to send to jail. But as we rely on algorithms to automate big, important decisions—in crime, justice, healthcare, transportation, and money—they raise questions about what we want our world to look like. What matters most: Helping doctors with diagnosis or preserving privacy? Protecting victims of crime or preventing innocent people being falsely accused? Hello World takes us on a tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us on a daily basis. Mathematician Hannah Fry reveals their inner workings, showing us how algorithms are written and implemented, and demonstrates the ways in which human bias can literally be written into the code. By weaving in relatable, real world stories with accessible explanations of the underlying mathematics that power algorithms, Hello World helps us to determine their power, expose their limitations, and examine whether they really are improvement on the human systems they replace.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

In The Dark Forest, Earth is reeling from the revelation of a coming alien invasion-in just four centuries’ time. The aliens’ human collaborators may have been defeated, but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth’s defense plans are totally exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains a secret. This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring plan that grants four men enormous resources to design secret strategies, hidden through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists, but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist, is baffled by his new status.

    "text": "Thoughts on Designing Machine Learning Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   Machine learning systems are both complex and unique. Complex because they consist of many different components and involve many different stakeholders. Unique because they’re data dependent, with data varying wildly from one use case to the next. In this book, you’ll learn a holistic approach to designing ML systems that are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and adaptive to changing environments and business requirements. Author Chip Huyen, co-founder of Claypot AI, considers each design decision–such as how to process and create training data, which features to use, how often to retrain models, and what to monitor–in the context of how it can help your system as a whole achieve its objectives. The iterative framework in this book uses actual case studies backed by ample references.

I would often forget what their disability was because it was a focus on their human experiences in a world that wasn’t always aligned with them.   Buy at Bookshop (non-affiliate link / affiliate link)\n\n\n\nThis book was a trip– gaining a perspective of experiences.\nIt never felt like inspiration porn that I can imagine a lot of disability-focus can turn into. (“Look how much they overcame!”) Instead, I felt that I had a better time simply relating to the author of each essay.\nI’m hesitant to say I ‘felt’ what they meant because there’s no way for anyone to truly know another’s experience.\nSometimes the stories would make you mad at society being unjust or simply its poor perceptions of what a disability is like.\nOther times, the stories felt inspiring and hopeful, but not in that cheap, sappy way. More along the lines that I can see how the world is moving forward in truly understanding those represented by this story, even if it is just little steps.\nI’ve been thinking for the past while we all become disabled over time. I think I really started thinking about it last year when listening to Adam Conover’s Factually! podcast episode ‘What Tech Gets Wrong About Disability with Ashley Shew’ (site & YouTube) which actually was recommended by the guest Ashley Shew. Related to that episode of the podcast, I can see how tech sometimes is championed as a ‘fix’ which really emphasizes how we tend to have a bias in how we think of disabilities.\nDisability Visibility is a great palette cleanser to readjust your thinking about disability and the world we live in."

Since the majority of the world’s data is unlabeled, conventional supervised learning cannot be applied. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, can be applied to unlabeled datasets to discover meaningful patterns buried deep in the data, patterns that may be near impossible for humans to uncover. Author Ankur Patel shows you how to apply unsupervised learning using two simple, production-ready Python frameworks: Scikit-learn and TensorFlow using Keras. With code and hands-on examples, data scientists will identify difficult-to-find patterns in data and gain deeper business insight, detect anomalies, perform automatic feature engineering and selection, and generate synthetic datasets. All you need is programming and some machine learning experience to get started. Compare the strengths and weaknesses of the different machine learning approaches: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning Set up and manage machine learning projects end-to-end Build an anomaly detection system to catch credit card fraud Clusters users into distinct and homogeneous groups Perform semisupervised learning Develop movie recommender systems using restricted Boltzmann machines Generate synthetic images using generative adversarial networks  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

It’s the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that’s a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are. Language is humanity’s most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What’s more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time. Even the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer “LOL” or “lol,” why ~sparkly tildes~ succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread.  \n\n\n\nReminder that language continues to evolve\nI’ve been listening to Gretchen McCullough’s (and Lauren Gawne’s) Lingthusiasm podcast for years but I’ve been meaning to read Because Internet for years! I’ve come across Gretchen’s work to a general audience over & over again so it was great to finally see their style in book form!\nIn short, the book does a great job in being approachable to how language usage evolved on the internet due to it’s technical limitations and challenges as well as the community who uses it. It’s great to see parallels made between less modern analogues of similar behavior. It emphasizes that the internet is new and allows novel forms of communication but it’s still just a bunch of humans communicating with each other.\nA good reminder that the internet is a ‘real place’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward. With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include: Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture) Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage Events, commands, and the message bus Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS) Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Dark humor. Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Babel. Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena’s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks. So when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I. So what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree. But June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves. With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F.

Worshipped as a religious icon by the fanatical Fremen, Paul faces the enmity of the political houses he displaced when he assumed the throne—and a conspiracy conducted within his own sphere of influence. And even as House Atreides begins to crumble around him from the machinations of his enemies, the true threat to Paul comes to his lover, Chani, and the unborn heir to his family’s dynasty…  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Now, physicist Leonard Susskind, assisted by a new collaborator, André Cabannes, returns to tackle Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Starting from the equivalence principle and covering the necessary mathematics of Riemannian spaces and tensor calculus, Susskind and Cabannes explain the link between gravity and geometry. They delve into black holes, establish Einstein field equations, and solve them to describe gravity waves. The authors provide vivid explanations that, to borrow a phrase from Einstein himself, are as simple as possible (but no simpler). An approachable yet rigorous introduction to one of the most important topics in physics, General Relativity is a must-read for anyone who wants a deeper knowledge of the universe’s real structure.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

OLIVIA WILDE to direct A24’s TV adaptation of THE CANDY HOUSE and A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD! From one of the most celebrated writers of our time comes an “inventive, effervescent” (Oprah Daily) novel about the memory and quest for authenticity and human connection. The Candy House opens with the staggeringly brilliant Bix Bouton, whose company, Mandala, is so successful that he is “one of those tech demi-gods with whom we’re all on a first name basis.” Bix is forty, with four kids, restless, and desperate for a new idea, when he stumbles into a conversation group, mostly Columbia professors, one of whom is experimenting with downloading or “externalizing” memory. Within a decade, Bix’s new technology, “Own Your Unconscious”—which allows you access to every memory you’ve ever had, and to share your memories in exchange for access to the memories of others—has seduced multitudes. In the world of Egan’s spectacular imagination, there are “counters” who track and exploit desires and there are “eluders,” those who understand the price of taking a bite of the Candy House. Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of narrative styles—from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter, and a chapter of tweets. Intellectually dazzling, The Candy House is also a moving testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for connection, family, privacy, and love. “A beautiful exploration of loss, memory, and history” (San Francisco Chronicle), “this is minimalist maximalism. It’s as if Egan compressed a big 19th-century novel onto a flash drive” (The New York Times).  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

With this practical book, you’ll learn techniques for extracting and transforming features—the numeric representations of raw data—into formats for machine-learning models. Each chapter guides you through a single data problem, such as how to represent text or image data. Together, these examples illustrate the main principles of feature engineering. Rather than simply teach these principles, authors Alice Zheng and Amanda Casari focus on practical application with exercises throughout the book. The closing chapter brings everything together by tackling a real-world, structured dataset with several feature-engineering techniques. Python packages including numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib are used in code examples. You’ll examine: Feature engineering for numeric data: filtering, binning, scaling, log transforms, and power transforms Natural text techniques: bag-of-words, n-grams, and phrase detection Frequency-based filtering and feature scaling for eliminating uninformative features Encoding techniques of categorical variables, including feature hashing and bin-counting Model-based feature engineering with principal component analysis The concept of model stacking, using k-means as a featurization technique Image feature extraction with manual and deep-learning techniques  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Keeping busy has always helped her cope, which she’s been doing since her eighteen-year-old son, Erik, mysteriously vanished on a boat in Puget Sound over thirty years ago. Tova becomes acquainted with curmudgeonly Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus living at the aquarium. Marcellus knows more than anyone can imagine but wouldn’t dream of lifting one of his eight arms for his human captors—until he forms a remarkable friendship with Tova. Ever the detective, Marcellus deduces what happened the night Tova’s son disappeared. And now Marcellus must use every trick his old invertebrate body can muster to unearth the truth for her before it’s too late.

The simple yet versatile triangle allows us to record music, map the world, launch rockets into space, and be slightly less bad at pool. Triangles underpin our day-to-day lives and civilization as we know it.  In Love Triangle, Matt Parker argues we should all show a lot more love for triangles, along with all the useful trigonometry and geometry they enable. To prove his point, he uses triangles to create his own digital avatar, survive a harrowing motorcycle ride, cut a sandwich, fall in love, measure tall buildings in a few awkward bounds, and make some unusual art. Along the way, he tells extraordinary and entertaining stories of the mathematicians, engineers, and philosophers—starting with Pythagoras—who dared to take triangles seriously. This is the guide you should have had in high school—a lively and definitive answer to “Why do I need to learn about trigonometry?” Parker reveals triangles as the hidden pattern beneath the surface of the contemporary world. Like love, triangles actually are all around. And in the air. And they’re all you need.  \n\n\n\nMatt Parker knows their way around righting triangle puns\nThis is the third book I read by Matt Parker and my first owned (signed!) from them! I’ve been watching them on YouTube (on Numberphile & Matt’s own channel Stand-up Maths) and I can feel the personality come out of the page. (But maybe that’s because I’ve watched their videos for so long.)\nIt really goes about showing that triangles are really everything (and ‘every triangle is a love triangle when you love triangles’).\nI think this is book (& really all that Matt Parker does) is so entertaining for a casual mathematical audience. I do hope all the silliness and seriousness they bring never ends.\nLove the continuing ‘gag’ of using unconventional page numbering– making it not easy to track\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

But now, acclaimed linguist Guy Deutscher has dared to reopen the issue. Can culture influence language—and vice versa? Can different languages lead their speakers to different thoughts? Could our experience of the world depend on whether our language has a word for “blue”? Challenging the consensus that the fundaments of language are hard-wired in our genes and thus universal, Deutscher argues that the answer to all these questions is—yes. In thrilling fashion, he takes us from Homer to Darwin, from Yale to the Amazon, from how to name the rainbow to why Russian water—a “she”—becomes a “he” once you dip a tea bag into her, demonstrating that language does in fact reflect culture in ways that are anything but trivial. Audacious, delightful, and field-changing, Through the Language Glass is a classic of intellectual discovery.  \n\n\n\nREADING\nREADING\nREADING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"
