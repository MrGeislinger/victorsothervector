Other things may leak through but it’ll be close to on brand.  For now, it’ll go through Substack but the actual material will be on this site. Eventually, newsletter emails will go out without Substack (but I gotta figure that out first).  I make no claims it will be on a ‘regular’ interval!  (But maybe bimonthly to monthly)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s Try That Again\n\n\nOh hey— it’s been a while.\n\n\n\nnewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 17, 2025\n\n\nVictor Geislinger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
