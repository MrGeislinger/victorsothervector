Might change but for now, you can see some of the things I’ve played around with over there.\nThreads @VictorsOtherVector: Where I’ve been most active & have fun just having good conversations\nYouTube @VictorsOtherVector: Been known to put out stuff sometimes usually about sofware engineering & ML/AI.\nLinkedIn: This is the best place to actually message me; just be genuine and not a robot and I’ll try to message back.\n\n\n\n\nThe other places I might as well mention:\n\nBluesky @VictorsOtherVector: Hardly participate on there right now. It just hasn’t been as fun as Threads.\nMastodon @sigmoid.social/@VictorsOtherVector: About the same as Bluesky; you can check me out there if you like."
