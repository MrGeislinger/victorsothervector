We literally see a couple characters deaths but also the characters having to be surrounded by the death and aftermath of killing. Marco describes screaming without any classic dialogue. Ax has two people literally fall over dead on top of him.\nEven Rachel who ‘wants’ to fight has a hard time processing the damage she causes.\nIn the end, the final solution is basically to make a real human (Visser Four’s host) to never exist. This is probably the most brutal thing I’ve seen in Animorphs where they (Cassie) literally explains to a human how he will no longer exist. And he accepts it.\nI do like they ponder for a second at how even the stuff they do now might have unintended & unpredictable outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

    "text": "Thoughts on How to Read a Book Revised and Updated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview   This was an interesting book to read in a few ways. First was that the ‘revised & updated’ edition was updated in the 1970s from the 1940s book, so it had me wondering how much advice the book gives is now ‘common knowledge’. The other interesting aspect for me (which might be related to my earlier point) is how much of the techniques and strategies described are things I already do! But overall, I think this book was worth reading in that it at least had me thinknig more about how I read & what I want to read.   Buy at Bookshop (non-affiliate link / affiliate link)\n\n\n\nI couldn’t help but think about this book in how it fits in with a world 50 years after it was ‘revised’.\nIt was funny to read in the introduction from the 1970s on how TV & radio are becoming more prevalent and reflecting how much more there is in the modern world.\nAs I read, I could see snippets of what seems to be presented as a ‘new’ way approach to reading (beyond what is taught in school & university) that have been incorporated in my learning from the (relative) modern age. One big aspect was what I was told as ‘talking to the text’ which was repeated over and over again when going through grade school. But there was other advice that I know has been said to me in the past but I can almost guarantee is rarely followed, such as ‘skimming’ or ‘pre-reading’.\nThere were some frankly laughable parts that I either felt was obvious or even outdated such as the section on ‘How to Use a Dictionary’. There were also parts that I felt less inclined to follow for myself such as being dilligent in taking notes on a sections to reference later.\nA lot of the techniques described really fits well with trying to use books as research towards an overarching goal.\nThe steps detailed basically can be summarized to be:\n\nElementary Reading: Basically reading for understanding\nInspectional Reading: Skimming & pre-reading to determine what the book is about (and if it’s worth reading for your ‘goal’)\nAnalytical Reading: Understanding the book as a whole and the arguments it presents and how convinced you are of them\nSyntopical Reading: Taking in multiple references to broaden & deepen knowledge in the area\n\n\nThere was a lot that I discovered I already do such as varying my speed while reading a book to focus on the ‘important’/‘relevant’ parts. I actually think some of the techniques could be revised to something like ‘How to Watch a Video’.\nI don’t feel like this was a ‘mind-blowing’ read, but at least for me it has me reflecting on how I want to approach future reading. In the past, I’ve grouped books to read together based on subject and even read some simulataneously. This ‘How to Read a Book’ has me thinking about maybe trying out doing almost a ‘research’ read. One thing that comes to mind is maybe trying to read philosophy as if it was part of a class. (I always wanted to do more humanities like that while at university but never found the time.)\n‘How to Read a Book’ can be refreshing in just having you reflect what you want to get out of your reading."

You learn that at least one human has befriended their Yerk parasite to resist against the Yerk attempt at domination. It’s actually kind of sweet I think.\nAt the same time, you feel the desperation of Cassie as she tries to plan a rescue and battle plan while also trying to save Ax’s life by performing brain surgery. Cassie’s narration seems to focus on empathy and this one feels like she really has it rough. You can see the struggle Cassie has to do in being in ‘soldier mode’.\nI love the resolution that they have for freeing Aftran which was to have them morph into a dolphin forever. It feels right considering that the non-violent solution is what happens. It really feels like a real Cassie story.\nLove that the Aftran gets morphing powers even if it means staying as a dolphin.

I would often forget what their disability was because it was a focus on their human experiences in a world that wasn’t always aligned with them.   Buy at Bookshop (non-affiliate link / affiliate link)\n\n\n\nThis book was a trip– gaining a perspective of experiences.\nIt never felt like inspiration porn that I can imagine a lot of disability-focus can turn into. (“Look how much they overcame!”) Instead, I felt that I had a better time simply relating to the author of each essay.\nI’m hesitant to say I ‘felt’ what they meant because there’s no way for anyone to truly know another’s experience.\nSometimes the stories would make you mad at society being unjust or simply its poor perceptions of what a disability is like.\nOther times, the stories felt inspiring and hopeful, but not in that cheap, sappy way. More along the lines that I can see how the world is moving forward in truly understanding those represented by this story, even if it is just little steps.\nI’ve been thinking for the past while we all become disabled over time. I think I really started thinking about it last year when listening to Adam Conover’s Factually! podcast episode ‘What Tech Gets Wrong About Disability with Ashley Shew’ (site & YouTube) which actually was recommended by the guest Ashley Shew. Related to that episode of the podcast, I can see how tech sometimes is championed as a ‘fix’ which really emphasizes how we tend to have a bias in how we think of disabilities.\nDisability Visibility is a great palette cleanser to readjust your thinking about disability and the world we live in."

And there does not seem any reference to evidence this is true and actually helps outside these stories. There are citations but looking carefully, they are quite a few pre-1960 references and usually are only citing the adjacent science versus anything directly related to this ‘inherited trauma’.\nI think this was a book I just grabbed from the library over a recommendation.

But looking up this book, you can see that this was from a ghost writer (Jeffrey Zeuhlke) so wondering if that’s what I was feeling.\nBack to the story, I love that the one human they met is casual about the known alien/Yerk base and seeing the Animorphs morphing. Also hilarious that the team basically just shrugs that it probably won’t matter since this guy is out on his own and no one believe him. Very different from every other time they worried about someone discovering their secret.\nThis is the first ghostwriter book; we’ll see how the rest go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

It’s always been young teenagers (middle school?) having to do impossible things and impossible decisions.\nBut over the past couple books, especially this one I think really drives that they’re not ‘kids’ any more and are never going back to a ‘normal’ life.\nRachel clearly sees that she has a ferocity that works well for ‘war’ but is definitely bothered by it. We see that Jake knows that he has to use his friends/team strategically. Even gentle Cassie is the one who designs the plot to trick the traitor in being forever a rodent.\nThe end shows it’s not a ‘victory’ but something that was necessary and never want to think about. But even at the end, it’s chilling to see they’re reminded it’s just not done and their traitor David will still be forever alone as a rat on a small island.\nI wonder if this is a point where the series shifts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"

Buy at Bookshop (non-affiliate link / affiliate link)\n\n\n\nI don’t know how I avoided hearing anything about this book (published in 1989) but I’m glad I wasn’t spoiled!\nI’m not a big reader of fiction, but I do tend to like a good Sci-Fi world, and Hyperion delivers!\nI can’t actually remember who recommended the book or where I even heard about it first, but it’s been on my reading list for a while now. I enjoy going into books blind as much as possible and that’s how I went into this one. I wasn’t sure if it was science fiction. I suggest the same to you if you’re reading this, so here’s your chance before continuing. (It’s not like my thoughts on the book are that profound anyways.)\n\nI was so happy going into the book with no expectations since this book unveils the world of Hyperion little-by-little over stories from 6 different travelers. This ~500 page book really is more of an introduction to a world that apparently kicks off the 4 part series. This can sound like a bit of a rip but I find these 6 stories broken into their own chapters and averaging about 80 pages stand well on their own while also building up more of the fictional world.\nI usually read by chapter where I dedicate the time to finish a complete chapter at a time, and this book works really well for my method! With the longest chapters being 100 pages, it’s something I could dedicate about 60-90 minutes to completely focus on one story at a time.\nThe sci-fi concepts from the book are interesting such as having to deal with time dilation but for the most part the concepts feel more like ‘magic’ than something I feel grounded in our own universe. But I think that’s alright since the main focus is about the world and this mysterious ‘Shrike’ who’s to bring the end of humanity & is traveling backwards in time. The important part is that it feels as if there are rules to this universe and we’re trying to understand how the characters and events are connected.\nSpeaking of the ‘traveling backwards through time’, some stories/chapters resonated with me more than others and it was the “The Scholar’s Tale” with Sol’s daughter Rachel aging backwards that hit me hard. This definitely feels like something I connect more with as a parent compared to if I read this when I was younger without kids. The way the story is told is heartbreaking with a dagger on my heartstrings being twisted throughout the chapter. I’m honestly a little afraid, though still intrigued, to hear about what ultimately happens. If you read this before having kids and are a parent now, I bet it’s worth reading again for that different emotional experience.\nI liked Hyperion’s style of the world being revealed through multiple characters’ backstories; the author, Dan Simmons, does a great job of making each feel like it is actually told by someone different. I don’t know what the rest of the series will be like (I’ve heard it’s not told in the same multiple perspectives) but this was good enough that it has me dedicated to get through the rest of the series to see what happens!\nI had to ask my public library to request the sequel from another library so I guess I’m too far invested now to quit.\nHyperion has got me hooked, so even if the rest of the series is different, I’m still looking forward to Dan Simmons writing on what happens next!"

Turns out the Yerks have been trying to remove ‘free will’ from humans by first testing on animals.  \n\n\n\nBasic exploring about treatment of non-human animals that a young teen might be able to recognize\nDefinitely very blunt about real-life treatment of non-human animals. Especially since it’s narrated by the only alien in the group who can technically be impartial to common practices done on Earth.\nAs you might expect, Cassie and Marco are on the opposite ends of the spectrum. The book clearly leans towards Cassie’s view that animals deserve our respect even if they aren’t fully sentient, but especially so. Marco has a much more direct “but they’re animals” attitude and is more than willing to accept animal harm if it’s especially inconvenient to their goals to prevent it. Ax, the narrator, represent the neutral voice and debate that we as human society has on where we draw lines.\nInteresting to see the book go from debating about whether they should save the chimpanzees in the lab to where the team is in a situation of deciding to free some humans in cages. Definitely tries to draw parallels in a relatively straight-forward fashion that a young teen might connect the dots.\nThis book overall doesn’t really progress the story (or at least I don’t see how it will). This being another ghost writer story, I’m seeing that these tend to be relatively self-contained. And I don’t know if it’s because we’re about 30 books into the series or because this was a ghost writer, but the beginning feels particularly rushed in explaining the Animorphs (as they do every book).\nI’ll probably not try and look at which are by ghost writters since I catch myself thinking about that more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBluesky Comments"
