Hi, I'm Victor Geislinger!

I'm a machine learning engineer / data scientist that also likes to think about
outreach and teaching others about technical happenings.

- **GitHub** [@MrGeislinger](https://github.com/MrGeislinger) has been my central place where I host things. Might change but for now, you can see some of the things I've played around with over there.
- **Threads** [@VictorsOtherVector](https://www.threads.net/@victorsothervector): Where I've been most active & have fun just having good conversations
- **YouTube** [@VictorsOtherVector](https://www.youtube.com/@VictorsOtherVector): Been known to put out stuff sometimes usually about sofware engineering & ML/AI.
- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrgeislinger/)**: This is the best place to actually message me; just be genuine and not a robot and I'll try to message back.

The other places I might as well mention:

- **Bluesky** [@VictorsOtherVector](https://bsky.app/profile/victorsothervector.bsky.social): Hardly participate on there right now. It just hasn't been as fun as [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@victorsothervector).
- **Mastodon** [@sigmoid.social/@VictorsOtherVector](https://sigmoid.social/@VictorsOtherVector): About the same as [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/victorsothervector.bsky.social); you can check me out there if you like.

The newsletter is a free-to-view medium for me share what I find interesting, so it'll mostly center around machine learning (AI), education, and language/linguistics. Other things may leak through but it'll be close to on brand.
<br /><br />
The newsletter comes through on Substack but the actual material will more or less will be from other places such as this site ([victorsothervector.com](https://victorsothervector.com)) or YouTube.
