Hi, I'm Victor Geislinger!

I'm a machine learning engineer / data scientist that also likes to think about
outreach and teaching others about technical stuff.

[@VictorsOtherVector.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/victorsothervector.bsky.social):
Really have leaned into it after the influx of people in late October / early
November. I'm pretty sure this will be where I'll be hanging out for the
foreseeable! 
- **GitHub** [@MrGeislinger](https://github.com/MrGeislinger): Been my central
place where I host things that I work on. Might change but for now you can see
some of the things I've played around with over there.
- **YouTube** [@VictorsOtherVector](https://www.youtube.com/@VictorsOtherVector):
Been known to put out stuff sometimes. It's usually about sofware engineering &
ML/AI.
- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrgeislinger/)**: This is the best
place to actually message me; just be genuine & not a robot and I'll try to
message back.

## Subscribe to Substack for a periodic newsletter!

Expect summaries and other snippets I want to point to. *I make no claims it will be at a 'regular' interval!*
[victorsothervector.substack.com](https://victorsothervector.substack.com/?r=2fco1e&utm_campaign=site_link)

[![](images/substack_subscribe.jpg)](https://victorsothervector.substack.com/?r=2fco1e&utm_campaign=site_img)

The newsletter is a free-to-view medium for me to share what I find interesting,
so it'll mostly center around machine learning (AI), education, and
language/linguistics. Other things may leak through but it'll be close to on
brand.
<br /><br />
The newsletter comes through on Substack but the actual material will more or
less will be from other places such as this site
([victorsothervector.com](https://victorsothervector.com)) or YouTube.

The other places I might as well mention:

- **Mastodon**
<a rel="me" href="https://sigmoid.social/@VictorsOtherVector">
@sigmoid.social/@VictorsOtherVector</a>: You can check me out there if you like
but [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/victorsothervector.bsky.social) is where
I'll likely be at
- **Threads** [@VictorsOtherVector](https://www.threads.net/@victorsothervector):
I started on Threads a while ago and it defintely had its ups. But it just
hasn't hit the right way in the long run with community. I'll probably not
really be on it much at all, but we'll see.
