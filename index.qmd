Hi, I'm Victor Geislinger!

I'm a machine learning engineer / data scientist that also likes to think about
outreach and teaching others about technical stuff.

- **GitHub** [@MrGeislinger](https://github.com/MrGeislinger): Been my central
place where I host things that I work on. Might change but for now you can see
some of the things I've played around with over there.
- **Threads** [@VictorsOtherVector](https://www.threads.net/@victorsothervector):
Where I've been most active & just having fun & good conversations.
- **YouTube** [@VictorsOtherVector](https://www.youtube.com/@VictorsOtherVector):
Been known to put out stuff sometimes. It's usually about sofware engineering &
ML/AI.
- **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrgeislinger/)**: This is the best
place to actually message me; just be genuine & not a robot and I'll try to
message back.

## Subscribe to Substack for a periodic newsletter!

Expect summaries and other snippets I want to point to. *I make no claims it will be at a 'regular' interval!*

The newsletter is a free-to-view medium for me to share what I find interesting,
so it'll mostly center around machine learning (AI), education, and
language/linguistics. Other things may leak through but it'll be close to on
brand.
<br /><br />
The newsletter comes through on Substack but the actual material will more or
less will be from other places such as this site
([victorsothervector.com](https://victorsothervector.com)) or YouTube.

Hardly participate on there right now. It just hasn't been as fun as
[Threads](https://www.threads.net/@victorsothervector).
- **Mastodon**
<a rel="me" href="https://sigmoid.social/@VictorsOtherVector">
@sigmoid.social/@VictorsOtherVector</a>: About the same as
